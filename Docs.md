"Hi! I'm [Your Name], and this is my Flight Search Engine 
built for the Frontend React Engineer assessment. 
Let me walk you through the key features."
```

```

**[1:30-2:30] Filtering & Price Graph**
```
"Here we have 229 flights. Notice the live price graph at 
the top showing trends. Now watch as I apply filters - 
the graph updates in real-time.

Let me filter by:
- Price range [adjust slider]
- Direct flights only [toggle]
- Specific airlines [select]
- Departure time [select afternoon]

See how both the flight list AND price graph update instantly."
```

**[2:30-3:30] Flight Details & Tech Stack**
```
"Clicking on a flight shows detailed itinerary with layovers, 
terminals, and aircraft types.

Tech stack:
- React 18 + TypeScript for type safety
- Zustand for state management
- React Query for data fetching
- Recharts for the price graph
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Amadeus API for real flight data

The app is fully responsive and works on mobile too."
```

**[3:30-4:00] Closing**
```
"Key highlights:
- Real-time filter updates
- Complex state management
- Clean, intuitive UX
- Production-ready code

Thanks for watching! The code is on GitHub and 
the app is live on Vercel."
```

“The price trends chart visualizes the distribution of prices across the current result set. As users apply filters — like stops, airlines, or price range — both the flight list and this chart update instantly, recalculating the trend and summary insights in real time.”
